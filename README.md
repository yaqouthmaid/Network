# Network

project Discription :

There	are	a	number	of	objectives	to	this	assignment	beyond	just	a	simple	socket	programming	
assignment.	 First,	 if	 you	 have	 not	 ever	 programmed	 sockets	 before,	 it	 is	 relatively	
straightforward,	 but	 still	 an	 effort is	 needed.	 Second,	 it	 will	 help	 you	 “tune	 up”	 your	
programming	 skills	 and	 prepare	 you	 for	 other	 upper-division	 networking	 courses.	 Third,	
because	you	can	use	 the	Internet	 to	look	 for	examples,	 this	assignment	will	help	you	see	just	
how	 many	 network-programming	 aids are	 out	 in	 the	 Internet.	 Finally,	 having	 some	 practical	
experience	will	put	many	of	the	protocol	concepts	we	learn	into	perspective.
Assignment:
You	should	design	a	server	side	that	waits	for	any	client	to	connect.	
1- You	should	design	a	server	side	that	waits	for	any	client	to	connect.	The	server	has many	
text	files	that	clients	need.	So, it	should	be	able	to	handle	several	connections.
2- You	should	design	a	client	side	that	needs	a	specific	file	from	the	server.	The	client	send	
the	name	of	needed	file	to	server.
3- The	server	read	the	data	for	given	file	and	encrypt	it	using	Vigenere	Cipher using	key	
“Your	first	and	last	name	without	space”,	then	send	the	encrypted	file	to	client.
4- The	client	receives	the	encrypted	text.
5- The	client	decrypts	the	file	using	the	same	key and	print	decrypted	data	on	file	
(output.txt).
6- Write	both	client	and	server	programs	demonstrating	this.
Submission:
Choose	either	Java, C or	Paython.
Your	task	is	to	write	the	server	and	client	programs	using	UDP	and	TCP.	You	will	turn	in	4	
different	programs.

1. Server	 using	UDP				 (file	name	to	turn	in	:	server_udp)

2. Client	 using	UDP							 (	file	name	to	turn	in	:	client_udp)

3. Server	 using	TCP							 (	file	name	to	turn	in	:	server_tcp)

4. Client	 using	TCP							 (file	name	to	turn	in	:	client_tcp)
